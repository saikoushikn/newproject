 * This service handles source tracking of metadata between a local project and an org.
 * Source tracking state is persisted to .sfdx/orgs/<orgId>/maxRevision.json.
 * This JSON file keeps track of `SourceMember` objects and the `serverMaxRevisionCounter`,
 * which is the highest `serverRevisionCounter` value of all the tracked elements.
 *
 * Each SourceMember object has 4 fields:
 * * serverRevisionCounter: the current RevisionCounter on the server for this object
 * * lastRetrievedFromServer: the RevisionCounter last retrieved from the server for this object
 * * memberType: the metadata name of the SourceMember
 * * isNameObsolete: `true` if this object has been deleted in the org
 *
 * ex.
 ```

  ```
 * In this example, `ApexClass__MyClass` has been changed in the org because the `serverRevisionCounter` is different
 * from the `lastRetrievedFromServer`. When a pull is performed, all of the pulled members will have their counters set
 * to the corresponding `RevisionCounter` from the `SourceMember` of the org.
